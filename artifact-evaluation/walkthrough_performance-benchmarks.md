Performance Benchmarks
======================

This walkthrough reproduces the most important results from ยง6.3 "Performance".
Most importantly, it reproduces Figure 8 and Figure 9.

Execute in a shell from the Vinter root directory:
```
fs-testing/scripts/script_run-paper-benchmark.sh
```

The benchmark may take between 30 and 60 minutes to complete and writes its
files to `results_paper-benchmark`.

Its final output should be similar to the following:
```

                                               count  mean               sstdev

The tester processes 31 unique crash images
that stem from 77 origins (ยง3.3)
and result in 7 unique semantic crash states.

```

The tables should approximately reproduce the numbers in Figure 8 and Figure 9 (depending on the hardware used).
The paragraph at the end of the output should further contain the same numbers as the corresponding sentence in ยง6.3.
